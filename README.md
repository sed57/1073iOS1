Three Facts About Me
---

*   I was born in Providence, Rhode Island
*   I don't like Macs or generally Apple products, not that I don't think they are a thriving, innovative company.
*   I don't like either teams in the super bowl and don't know who I will root for during the game.

I'm using github, which means that the changes that I make in this file, once I commit and push them, will be visible on the main page of this repo. 

Yep. This is a change.
